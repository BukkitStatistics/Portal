## Requirements ##
In order to track statistics, you will need a web-server that fulfills the following requirements:

- MySQL v.5 or higher
- PHP 5.2.x or higher

The Bukkit plugin was designed to work regardless of the Bukkit version, however, due to the sheer complexity of the code, it is only guaranteed to work with the version it was built with.

## Installation ##
To use these development build you need to install the required libraries via ``composer install``.
